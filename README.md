- 👋 Hi, I’m @MITsmartie
- 👀 I’m interested in just...learning new things! I want to develop a new sense of intelligence and deepen both my current knowledge and my future understanding of coding and its multiple uses. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Scratch, but I have done python and Java script coding games by myself in the past.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on intense studies and possible medical-treatment devices...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am hoping to be accepted into some of the top schools of my dreams, such as MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, Notre Dame, etc.!
